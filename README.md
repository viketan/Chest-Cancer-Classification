# Chest-Cancer-Classification
The Chest-Cancer-Classification project is an advanced machine learning application designed to aid in the early detection and diagnosis of chest cancer through the analysis of medical imaging data. This project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to accurately classify chest images into various categories of cancerous and non-cancerous findings.

## Key Features:
- Image Analysis: Utilizes state-of-the-art CNN architectures to analyze chest X-rays and CT scans for effective classification.
- Data Preprocessing: Implements robust data preprocessing techniques to enhance image quality and improve model performance, including normalization and augmentation.
- Model Training: Employs transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to optimize model accuracy while reducing training time.
Performance Metrics: Evaluates model performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring reliable results.
- User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple interface for healthcare professionals to input medical images and receive classification results.
- Motivation:
With the increasing prevalence of chest cancer and the significant impact of early detection on patient outcomes, this project aims to assist healthcare providers in making informed diagnostic decisions, ultimately improving patient care and treatment success rates.
